    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Are you a fan of good food? What about delicious pork cooked fork tender in a beautiful medley of herbs and spices?
      How about that same pork, then shredded and cooked in its own juices until completely brimming with flavour? What if we then took
      that pork and some of its fat rendered from cooking and pan-fried it until perfectly golden brown?
      </p>
      <p>If you're still here, you must be interested. Let us drop any formalities and get down to buisness. You want this pork, and I know how to make this pork.
      Solution seems obvious, huh?
      </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h4>Serves 8-12 (or 1-4 for multiple days)</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>4 lb pork shoulder</li>
        <li>1 onion</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>3/4 cup orange juice</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp salt</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp cumin</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp oregano</li>
        <li>2 tsp black pepper</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Peel and chop your onion and garlic.</li>
        <li>Add pork shoulder to slow-cooker or oven-safe pan, along with the rest of the ingredients. Rub everything on the pork.</li>
        <li>Turn your slow-cooker on high or put in an 250F oven for 5-6 hours, or until easily pulled apart with a fork.</li>
        <li>Take pork out of your pot and onto a plate or cutting board. Using two forks, shred the pork.</li>
        <li>Pour the remaining juice into a pot and put over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Add the shredded pork to the pot and cook, stiring, until the liquid has reduced by nearly half.</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat and allow the pork to cool. Once cooled, put in the fridge overnight.</li>
        <li>Take some of the fat from the top of the carnitas container and put it in a pan over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Add some pork and a bit of the juices to the pan, and allow it to cook undisturbed for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir the pork around, allowing multiple sides to get browning.</li>
        <li>Once browned to your liking, remove from the heat and enjoy!</li>
      </ol>
