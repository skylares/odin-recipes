    <h1>Gyudon  牛丼 </h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>No dish seems as ubiquitous throughout Japanese food culture as Gyudon.
      Gyudon is simple, like much of Japan's culinary mainstays, yet packs impressive flavour.
      In simple terms, gyudon is a beef bowl; thinly sliced beef cooked in a delicious sauce sitting
      on top of a steaming bowl of rice, topped with perfectly cooked egg, green onions, and ginger.
      </p>
      <p>Maybe just a beef bowl, maybe something more than that. Gyudon is adapatable, it can be what
        you need it to be. But there's a catch - gyudon needs something in return. Gyudon needs your 
        support on the upcoming election in Titusville. Without every day voters like you, we will never
        reach our campaign goals of eradicating all ants and sending the first preschool class to orbit Mars.
        Please, I give so much, yet ask for so little in return. Just this one vote?
      </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h4>Serves 2</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>1 white onion</li>
        <li>2 green onions</li>
        <li>3/4 lb thinly sliced beef</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp canola oil</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp sugar</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp sake</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp mirin</li>
        <li>3 Tbsp soy sauce</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Thinly slice the white onion and green onions, keep separate.</li>
        <li>Add the oil to a pan over medium-high heat. Once shimmering, add the white onion.</li>
        <li>Cook, stiring frequently enough to prevent burns until the onions are lightly browned.</li>
        <li>Add the sugar, sake, mirin, and soy sauce to the pan. Stir and allow to cook for 1-2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the beef, stir to evenly distribute throughout the sauce.</li>
        <li>While the beef cooks, crack the eggs into a bowl and lightly whisk them. You do not want a perfectly homogenenous mixture.</li>
        <li>Once the beef only has a little red left showing, pour the egg mixture on top and cover the pan. Cook for about 5 minutes, or until the egg is set enough for your liking. If you trust your eggs, a bit runny is okay!</li>
        <li>Put the beef mixture on freshly cooked white rice, and top with your green onions.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
      </ol>
