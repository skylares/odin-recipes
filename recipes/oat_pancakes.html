    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Ever since I was a kid I loved pancakes. No matter the flavour; blueberry, pecan, plain, chocolate chip, etc.
      it never mattered, as long as I could get my sugary fix. I needed those cakes that originated from the pan, every 
      bite was an earth-shattering experience. Every sniff of flour-y goodness would reignite my life-long obsession
      with these desserts masquerading as breakfast. If any food is truly irresistible, it's pancakes, and if you are looking
      for the ultimate recipe, look no further.</p>

      <p>Below you will find my secret oatmeal pancake recipe. This recipe has been passed down for hundreds of generations, 
      never being seen by anyone outside of the Kesselring family until now. I implore you to give this one a try, your
      life will never be the same again.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h4>Serves 2 people</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>3/4 cup instant or old-fashioned oats</li>
        <li>1/3 cup milk</li>
        <li>1 ripe banana</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/4 - 1/2 tsp salt</li>
      </ul>
      
    <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Combine all ingredients in a blender and blend until combined. It does not need to be completely smooth. </li>
        <li>Let batter rest for 5 minutes. In the mean time melt 1 Tbsp of butter over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Pour approx. half of the batter into the pan, tilting the pan to spread the batter evenly.</li>
        <li>Once you see bubbles on the top of the pancake, flip it and continue to cook 3-7 minutes or until nicely browned.</li>
        <li>Top with butter, syrup, nuts, fruit, and anything else you like, and enjoy!</li>
      </ol>
