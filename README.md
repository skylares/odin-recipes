# odin-recipes

This project is to build out a simple recipe website using HTML. This website will include recipes, with instructions and pictures, all contained within a navigatible website.

 This project will demonstrate a basic understanding of HTML; including using elements like lists and headers, displaying information on the screen in a set order, and making a navigatable website.
 
I will also be using git and github to maintain proper version control, keep a running record of changes, and demonstrate a basic understanding of the command line
